## Title
**Morphometric analysis of monogenetic volcanoes in the Macolod Corridor using MORVOLC and the sectorial approach**

## Abstract
<p align=justify>
The Macolod Corridor is a region of active volcanism in Luzon with over 200 volcanic centers. Studying the morphometry of monogenetic volcanoes can provide valuable information on their growth and evolution. The current whole edifice approach does not capture the variability in morphometry, so a sectorial approach was used to evaluate the asymmetry of cones and domes and infer the factors that controlled their asymmetry. The study found that the steeper the volcano, the more symmetrical it tended to be, and the elongations of the volcano base were parallel to NE-SW trending faults in the region. Wind could also influence the asymmetry of volcanoes. It was also found that dacitic-rhyolitic domes tended to be more asymmetrical than basaltic cones. The orientation of the steepest and least steep sectors for volcanoes emplaced on the flanks of polygenetic cones varied significantly and may be influenced by more complex factors.
